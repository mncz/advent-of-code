This repository proudly presents my Python solutions to the puzzles from the Advent of Code event for various years, including the current. Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge where participants solve two programming puzzles each day from December 1st to December 25th. Brace yourself for a journey through a collection of code snippets that may not break any speed records but certainly solve the puzzles ‚Äì eventually.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an online event created by Eric Wastl that takes place every December. It consists of 25 programming puzzles released on each day leading up to Christmas. The puzzles cover a variety of topics and difficulty levels, making it a fun and challenging way to improve programming skills.

## Contributing

If you've somehow managed to find ways to optimize these solutions (let's face it, there's always room for improvement), or if you just want to join the inefficiency party, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or improvement (bonus points if you can make it less inefficient).
3. Make your changes and commit them with a clear and concise message.
4. Push your changes to your fork.
5. Create a pull request, describing your changes.

Remember, we embrace the beauty of code that might not set any land-speed records but gets the job done. So, don't be shy to contribute, even if it means adding a few extra seconds to the runtime. It's all part of the charm.

Happy coding! üéÑ‚ú®
